<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is complete website with backend api server with database server and a nice frontend. To access the dashboard user of this website must login with their gmail account. If the account is already save as admin, then the user is redirected to admin dashboard, otherwise the user is redirected to user dashboard.

In the admin dashboard, admin can create and delete services and manage client's service bookings.

In the user dashboard, user can book service, look up for their previously booked services status and add comment for the service provider.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
